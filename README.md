# TODO for portfolio

- write tests
- use tailwind
- create light and dark themes
- loading animation on fetch
- add gif list sharing functionality. User can create a list add an unique id and any user can fetch it with the id. Use firebase/google sheets.   
- implement unlimited scroll. Make it that user can only lock 100 gifs in total (to look like there is a paid version with no limits).
- add card component for each gif for it to look like polaroid picture
- add routing. Add a few pages for different kinds of gifs
